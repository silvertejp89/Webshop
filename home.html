              The Sonfj√§llet national park has always been a great source of
              inspiration for us at Sandqvist. Having a cabin nearby has made it
              possible going on hikes; on skis during the winter and by foot
              during the summer, spring and fall.
            </p>

              At Sandqvist, the Nordic nature means everything. We pick up all
              our ideas, inspiration, lust and ambition from the cold mountains,
              deep forests and roaming waters.

              Sometimes we camp in a tent overnight, but this time, during late
              fall, we decided to sleep in the cabin and get up really early so
              we could meet the rising sun while having breakfast on the
              mountain. When we began walking there wasnt much snow at all, but
              as we ascended more and more covered the ground, until we were
              walking on a thick windswept layer of snow.
            </p>
            <p>
              We kept on walking for an hour or two, and when the first rays of
              morning sun appeared above the peaks, we sat down in a sheltered
              ravine and ate our breakfast with a scenic view, high above the
              tree line.
