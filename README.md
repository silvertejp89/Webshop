Approach
You need to run this project as an agile development project. Use ceremonies & artifacts you have learned such as:

Daily standups
Sprint planning
Backlog
Retrospectives
You should have more than one iteration, choose whether you want to have sprints or use Kanban.

Styling
Try to work with as much styling as you can manage. It's a fun task to include in a portfolio in the future. Ensure your animations are subtle. Work with hero images, perhaps with a bit of video/audio. And create a good structure with your SCSS right from the start.
